# C/C++ {#c-c}

In this section, we will discuss how to fuzz C/C++ projects, including how to set up a fuzzer in your project. While there are many options for fuzzing C/C++ projects, we will ground this tutorial in the practical use of libFuzzer and AFL++: two of the most prominent fuzzing tools in use today that can be applied to any C/C++ project.

For a general introduction about fuzzing and fuzzing setup (e.g., the harness, fuzzer runtime, instrumentation, and SUT), refer to the [introduction]({{% relref "fuzzing#introduction-to-fuzzers" %}}).
